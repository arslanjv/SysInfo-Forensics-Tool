# SysInfo Forensics Tool

*SYSInfo Forensics Tool* is a Python-based project designed to assist in digital forensic investigations by gathering detailed system information from both live systems and Exported Registry files. The tool leverages Python and Flask to provide an accessible web-based interface for investigators and analysts.

## Features

- **Live System Scan**: Gather detailed system information from the current running system.
- **Forensics Scan**: Analyze Exported Registry files (like SYSTEM, SAM, SOFTWARE, SECUIRTY etc.) to extract system information from it.
- **JSON Output**: Outputs collected data in a structured JSON format for further analysis.
- **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for forensic analysis and system information gathering.
- **Web Application Interface**: Flask-based web app for user-friendly interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.5 or later
- Flask

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arslanjv/SysInfo-Forensics-Tool.git
   cd SysInfo-Forensics-Tool/df_proj
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  #for Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     #for Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

## Usage

### 1. Live System Scan
- Launch the application and select the "Live System Scan" option.
- The tool will collect system information of the host machine and present the results in a structured format.

### 2. Forensics Scan
- Enter folder path containing extracted Registry files in the Forensics Analysis Webpage.
- The tool will analyze the files and extract system information from it.

### 3. Output
- The results of the scans are saved in JSON format, such as SysInfo.json or forensics1.json, for further investigation.
